Ideas:
- Implement a firewall to only allow known IPs to connect.
- Server-Sent Events, one way and push out to endpoints.

Using a Message Queue or Pub/Sub System
Integrate with a message queue or pub/sub system like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis Pub/Sub:

    Server-Side:
        Subscribe to RethinkDB changes.
        Publish these changes to the message queue.
        Implement a service that listens to the queue and pushes updates via WebSockets, SSE, or even HTTP requests to clients.
    Client-Side:
        Clients could either:
            Directly connect to the message queue if possible (less common).
            Or connect to your API via WebSockets or SSE for updates.
